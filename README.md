# teleprinter
A tool to compile LaTeX-like markup into html.

I wrote (and am still writing) this for my websiter, [here](http://home.in.tum.de/~stuebinm/index.html).

It's incredibly basic (seriously, it's got a grand total of 15 unique commands for now). To get anything useful out of this program you'll need to define one hell of a lot more. Take a look at my website repo for an example of that.
